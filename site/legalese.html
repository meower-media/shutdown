						<strong>Deletion Scheduling</strong>: After 14 days have passed

						inactivity period has expired (with respect to the 14 days after the
						initial notification), one final notification will be sent to the
						account owner stating that the account will be permanently deleted 7
						days later. This provides a final opportunity for the account owner
						to prevent deletion by logging in.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Preventing Deletion</strong>: If the user logs back in
						during the 2-year inactivity period or after the final notification,
						the deletion request will be aborted, and the account will remain
						active.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Final Deletion</strong>: If the user logs back in after the

				period.
