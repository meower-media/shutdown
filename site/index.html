			<h3>Why is Meower shutting down?</h3>
			<details>
				<summary><p>Please read the actual announcement</p></summary>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						It is with a heavy heart that I announce Meower will be ceasing
						operations indefinitely on December 1st, 12am, UTC.
					</p>
					<p>
						Remember when Meower started out on the Scratch forums about 4 and a
						half years ago? It really has been a crazy and memorable journey…
						But, all things must come to an end, and soon, Meower will be
						continuing that trend.
					</p>
					<p>
						There have been many factors over the past year that lead us to this
						decision. Primarily, our team members are unable to provide adequate
						time to Meower. Most of us are teenagers, we have other things going
						on in our lives, and we really don’t have the resources to handle a
						social media platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						Addressing the illicit content being sent on Meower, I’m not gonna
						lie, it’s the reason why I’m choosing to step away now and not
						later. Our team of volunteer moderators should not have to review
						such disgusting content. Shutting down Meower will mean they will
						never have to review such content on Meower ever again.
					</p>
					<p>
						I will also be departing from the team. The reason Meower will be
						ceasing operations instead of just me leaving is because Meower has
						many, many problems the team needs time to address, Meower doesn’t
						have any other (active) backend developers to continue maintaining
						the site, and half of Meower’s infrastructure is ran by me, with the
						other half ran by @ethernet. @ethernet has said they will be leaving
						with me.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am really sorry to all of the team members, client developers, bot
						developers, and everyone in our community that it has come down to
						this. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find somewhere else to
						continue hanging out!
					</p>
					<p>
						P.S. Meower may come back in the future. Eris and DaCatBlock are
						co-owners of the project, and they will have the final say once I
						leave. If Meower does come back, I hope it has the same morals with
						regards to user privacy and FOSS.

			<h3>Who decided to shut down Meower?</h3>
			<p>
				Many team members, including Tnix and Ethernet (as mentioned in the
				announcement), decided to leave the team before the shutdown was decided
				on.
			</p>
			<h3>What will happen to my data?</h3>
			<p>
				Your data will remain stored in accordance with our terms until November
				21st, 2025. You may <a href="#export">export your data</a> until then,
				when it will be securely deleted.
			</p>
			<h3>Should I delete my account?</h3>
			<p>
				While you can always delete your account, your data will remain securely
				stored in accordance with our terms until November 21st, 2025, when it
				will be securely deleted.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I delete my data before it's deleted by you?</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, you may delete your data using the same form as to export your
				data.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I continue using Meower?</h3>
			<p>No, you can't continue using Meower as a platform.</p>
			<h3>What if I self-host?</h3>
			<p>
				We can't stop you from self-hosting, however we really don't recomend
				doing so, especially since much better open-source alternatives do
				exist. Additionally, we won't provide support for the code beyond what
				we can in our free time.
			</p>
			<h3>Will there be a Meower 2?</h3>
			<p>No, we are not continuing the Meower project.</p>
			<h3>Where should I go?</h3>
